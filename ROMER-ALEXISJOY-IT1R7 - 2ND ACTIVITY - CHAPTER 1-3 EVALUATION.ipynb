By studying Data structures and algorithms, it thought me that i can deal with different ways of arranging, processing and storing data. Data structure and Algorithm provide a set of techniques to the programmer to handle the data efficiently. They can write the code in any programming language with minimal effort\n",
      "I've also learned that there is an interface and implementation in every data structure. Interface is the set of operations supported by a data structure. An interface provides only the list of operations supported, the type of parameters that are acceptable and the return type. Meanwhile, Interior representation of data structure is provided by implementation. Implementation also defines the algorithms used in data structure operations\n",

As we are aware, every language programmer has basic constructs such as loops, flow control, etc. Those common builds can be used to write an algorithm.\n",
      "Lastly, I’ve learned about the algorithm complexity. First is we have time complexity. By definition, time complexity is the amount of time that an algorithm takes to run depending on the input length. The amount of operations performed by the algorithm is indicated here by the length of the input. This shows clearly what exactly the complexity of time tells us. Second is the space complexity. The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.\n"
